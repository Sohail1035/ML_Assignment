Coursework: Comparing SKLEARN Clustering Algorithms

This project compares various clustering algorithms from the sklearn library, focusing on their performance for exploratory data analysis (EDA). The aim is to identify clustering algorithms that offer intuitive parameter settings, stability across runs, and high performance for large datasets. The project provides insights into which algorithms are best suited when little is known about the data and helps avoid incorrect results that can mislead further analysis.
